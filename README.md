# am.AgileTable

Angular 12 configurable table project example

## Error handling

The application implements [Global Error Handling](https://pkief.medium.com/global-error-handling-in-angular-ea395ce174b1) for handle all errors in a single place.

Click to the column title (for columns with "sortable=true" settings) for making sorting. It will trigger an error and an error message appear.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
